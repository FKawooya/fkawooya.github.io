I am a Senior AI Researcher specializing in multimodal machine learning. Most of my research has been at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, developing large-scale generative models that produce language, images, and/or actions. During my career I have moved between the tech (Google, Microsoft) and finance industries (Balyasny, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs). My current role developing AI models for investing combines both these aspects of my career. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Australian National University in 2018 where I was advised by Stephen Gould. Previously I was a sell-side securities analyst with Credit Suisse in Sydney. I have the (fairly rare) distinction of winning two university medals, in Finance (from the University of Sydney) and Computer Engineering (from the University of New South Wales).
